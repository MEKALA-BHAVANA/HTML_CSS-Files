    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.<br>
        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. 
         By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.<br> 
         An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".
         The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture.<br>
         The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements
        (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
